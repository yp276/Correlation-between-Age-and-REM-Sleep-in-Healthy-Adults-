### Overview of the Dataset

A clinical dataset named "Sleep Efficiency" was collected as part of a
study conducted in Morocco by a group of artificial intelligence
engineering students from ENSIAS.

The data was collected using a combination of self-reported surveys,
actigraphy, and polysomnography which is a sleep monitoring technique.
The data was then analyzed to understand the relationship between
lifestyle factors and sleep patterns and to identify any potential areas
for intervention to improve sleep.

### Explanation of key variables

It's important to notate that our team is excluding the Sleep Efficiency
column since there's insufficient data to support the values. More
specifically, the dataset excludes information regarding how the sleep
efficiency scores were obtained.

### Confounders

Gender: Research supports that gender differences exist in sleep
patterns Men and women may have different amounts of REM sleep at
different ages (Kováčová K, Stebelová K.) If you do not account for
gender as a confounding variable in your analysis, you might incorrectly
attribute differences in REM sleep to age when they are actually due to
gender differences

Caffeine: A known stimulant that can affect sleep patterns Age often
corresponds with changes in caffeine consumption habits and
correspondingly, body's ability to metabolize caffeine Caffeine
(generally) makes it more difficult to fall asleep, reduce total sleep
duration, and disrupt the overall quality of sleep (O'Callaghan F,
Muurlink O, Reid N.)

Alcohol: A CNS depressant, which leads to a reduction in REM sleep and
increased sleep disruption Tends to suppress the REM stage Age often
corresponds with changes in drinking patterns and correspondingly,
body's ability to metabolize alcohol (Colrain IM, Nicholas CL, Baker
FC.)

Exercise: Regular exercise can promote deep, restorative sleep including
slow-wave sleep (SWS), which often precede REM sleep Increased SWS →
more pronounced REM sleep Age often corresponds with changes in activity
levels and physical fitness Younger → more physically active and engage
in regular exercise (Kline CE)

Smoking: Nicotine is a stimulant that can affect sleep onset and
maintenance, leading to disruptions in the sleep cycle, including REM
sleep Overall, reduced sleep quality (less restorative and more
fragmented sleep) Smoking habits tend to change with age and lead to
cumulative effects Younger → more likely to start smoking, while older
individuals may be more inclined to quit or reduce their smoking due to
health concerns or lifestyle changes Older individuals who have been
long-term smokers may have accumulated more health issues related to
smoking (Wetter DW, Young TB.)

### Key variables

In accordance with our research question, we select the Age, Gender,
Sleep duration, REM sleep percentage, Caffeine consumption, Alcohol
consumption, Smoking status, and Exercise frequency columns. Please
note, Sleep.duration column will be used for the calculation of REM
sleep in minutes.

```{r}
sleep_raw <- select(data, c(Age, Gender,Sleep.duration, REM.sleep.percentage, Caffeine.consumption, Alcohol.consumption, Smoking.status,Exercise.frequency))
head(sleep)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Check for missing values

```{r}
sum(is.na(sleep_raw)) # 45 NA values
dim(sleep_raw)
```

#### Omit NAs and create a new dataframe titled "sleep_clean", in which when you check the sum there's 0 NA values

```{r}
sleep_clean <- na.omit(sleep_raw)
sum(is.na(sleep_clean))
dim(sleep_clean)
```

#### Filter dataframe in accordance with research question

Please note, in accordance with the CDC, FDA, and Mayo Clinic
Guidelines, we define healthy adults in this dataset as those who are 18
years and older, non-smokers, have an exercise frequency greater than 0
times/week, consume less than or equal to 400 mg caffeine/day, and
consume less than or equal to 5 oz alcohol/day.

After filtering, the new dataset titled "filtered_data" contains 185
individuals.

```{r}
filtered_data <- sleep_clean %>%
  filter(Age >= 18,Smoking.status == 'No',Exercise.frequency > 0, Caffeine.consumption <= 400, Alcohol.consumption <= 5)
dim(filtered_data)
```

Since we have filtered the data, we select the Age, Gender, Sleep
duration, and REM sleep percentage columns, which are the only needed
columns for further analysis. The new dataframe is titled "sleep".

```{r}
# getting the final table to work with 
sleep <- select(filtered_data, c(Age, Gender, Sleep.duration, REM.sleep.percentage))
head(sleep)
dim(sleep)
```

#### Double check for missing values

```{r}
sum(is.na(sleep)) # 0 NA values 
dim(sleep)
```

### Issues with data quality:

1)  Set binary coding for gender. For further analysis we have converted
    the "Gender" column into 0s and 1s, binary coding, allowing us to
    reduces dimensionality, improves interpretability and improves
    consistency

```{r}
# female = 0 (baseline)
# male = 1 
sleep$Gender[sleep$Gender == "Female"] <- 0
sleep$Gender[sleep$Gender == "Male"] <- 1
```

2)  Converting REM measurement into minutes In the dataset REM
    measurement is presented in percentage of the time spent asleep as
    column "Sleep.duration". Thus to convert into minutes:

a)  the value is divided by 100 giving us a decimal percentage
b)  "Sleep.duration" is multiplied by 60 to give the value in minutes
c)  multiply the decimal percentage with time in minutes
d)  save new values into the separate column

A new column is added to the dataset titled "REM", which represents REM
sleep (in minutes).

```{r}
sleep$REM <- ((sleep$REM.sleep.percentage/100)*sleep$Sleep.duration*60)
head(sleep)
```

### Check assumptions of normality of REM

When observing the mean and median of REM sleep (non-log2 transformed),
the data almost centered equally since mean is 102 and median is 101.

```{r}
#looking at mean and median of REM
mean(sleep$REM) 
median(sleep$REM) 
```

For a visual representation, the histogram of non-log2 transformed REM
sleep is fairly evenly distributed with a slight right skewness.
Additionally, looking at the histogram, it's evident that there's no
clear outliers.

```{r}
# Not log2 transformed REM sleep (min)
ggplot(data=sleep, aes(REM)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "#D8BFD8") +
  labs(
    x = "REM Sleep (in minutes)",  # X-axis label
    y = "Frequency",                # Y-axis label
    title = "Histogram of REM Sleep Duration (not log2 tranformed)",  # Title 
  )
```

Now, observe the mean and median of log2-transformed REM values. The
mean and median are slightly closer together, but we still can't assume
normalization.

```{r}
#looking at mean and median of REM
mean(log2(sleep$REM)) 
median(log2(sleep$REM)) 
```

For a visual representation, the histogram of log2 transformed REM sleep
is fairly evenly distributed with a slight left skewness, similar to the
histogram of non-log2 transformed REM sleep.

```{r}
# log transformed data of REM sleep (min)
ggplot(data=sleep, aes(log2(REM))) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "#D8BFD8") +
  labs(
    x = "REM Sleep (in minutes)",  # X-axis label
    y = "Frequency",                # Y-axis label
    title = "Histogram of REM Sleep Duration (log2 tranformed)",  # Title 
  )
```

Overall, there is not that much of a difference between non-log2
transformed and log2-transformed REM sleep. In this case, a log2
transformation will not necessarily contribute to normalizing data,
linearizing the relationship, or improving interpretability .

#### Finding lowest and highest REM Sleep in minutes

This means that the the lowest amount of REM sleep (in minutes) in our
subset is 63 minutes. The maximum amount of REM sleep (in minutes) in
our subset is 145.8 minutes.

```{r}
min(sleep$REM) # 63
max(sleep$REM) # 145.8 
```

### Exploring the "Age" variable

a)  Mean and Median. The average age in this dataset is 40. The median
    is 40, so additionally supports log2 transformation makes data more
    normally distributed.

```{r}
mean(sleep$Age) 
median(sleep$Age) 
```

b)  Find youngest and oldest adult in dataset. The youngest individual
    in dataset is 18 y/o, while the oldest individual in dataset is 67
    y/o.

```{r}
min(sleep$Age) 
max(sleep$Age) 
```

c)  View proportion of each age group. As you can see, there's an
    overall even distribution of patients within each age group, with
    only 12 individuals aged 58-68.

```{r}
sleep$group <- cut(sleep$Age, breaks = seq(18,68,by = 10), right = TRUE, include.lowest = TRUE)
sleep %>% 
group_by(group) %>%
count(group)
```

#### Histogram for age distribution: a visual representation of how age is spread out

```{r}
# Visual representation of age proportion
hist(sleep$Age, 
     main = paste("Histogram of age distribution"),
     col = "#FFA07A",
     xlab = "Age")
```

### Association between REM and gender

Prior to analysis, it's imperative to explore the relationship between
REM sleep and Gender since Gender will be the confounder used in further
analysis.

Foremost, we take a look at the distribution of females and males in our
subset. It's reported that there are 94 females and 91 males.

```{r}
gender_counts <- sleep %>% count(Gender)
print(gender_counts)
```

Looking at the histograms of REM sleep of females vs. males, the
distribution is fairly the same.

```{r}
# Add colors for easier interpretation, in which Females (0) are red and Males (1) are blue
custom_colors <- c("0" = "lightcoral", "1" = "lightblue")

# Modify ggplot code
ggplot(data = sleep, aes(x = REM, fill = factor(Gender))) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Gender)) +
  
  # Add x-axis and y-axis titles
  labs(x = "REM Sleep (in minutes)", y = "Frequency") +
  
  # Apply custom colors
  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors)
```

### Hypothesis testing

Hypotheses that we're testing: 
-Null hypothesis(H0): There is no
association between REM sleep and age in healthy adults 
-Null hypothesis(H0): There is no difference in REM sleep 
between males and females

Parameters that we're testing: 
-Welch's T-test: P-value 
-Simple linear regression: beta0 (intercept) and beta1 (X) 
-Multiple linear regression: beta0 (intercept), beta1 (X1), and beta2 (X2)

Models using: 
-Welch's T-test 
-Simple linear regression 
-Multiple linear regression

#### Assign x and y variables (for simplicity) to data

```{r}
x <- sleep$REM[sleep$Gender== "0"]
y <- sleep$REM[sleep$Gender== "1"]
```

#### Welch's T-test comparing the REM sleep in females and males on data

We chose a T-test over a Z-test because the variances of females and
males are not equal, so will provide more robust results.

```{r}
##use the built-in t.test function:
t.test(x,y)

# Welch's t-test 
# P-value = 0.1071
# 95% CI: -0.9864725 and 10.0103911
```

Welch's T-test interpretation of results: Please note, the null
hypothesis is only in context of this T-test, not in relation to our
project's hypothesis.

The P-value is 0.1071, which is > 0.05 (alpha). Thus, we fail to reject
the null hypothesis, meaning there is not a significant difference in
REM sleep between females and males.

Additionally, the 95% Confidence Interval is (-0.9864725 and
10.0103911), meaning we are 95% confident that the true population
parameter (difference in means between male and female REM sleep levels)
lies within the interval. Since the interval includes zero, it means
that the true difference could be zero (no difference) or positive
(indicating higher REM sleep in females), but it cannot be confidently
determined based on this analysis alone.

In summary, the results of the confidence interval are consistent with
the p-value because the confidence interval includes 0 and the p-value
is greater than 0.05, so there is NOT a statistically significant
difference (fail to reject null hypothesis) in REM sleep between male
and females.

## Main analysis 

### Simple Linear regression to find the association between REM and Age

Based on this graph, it can visually be seen that there is slight
negative linear correlation between REM sleep and age. Please note, we
included an OLS fit because it minimizes the sum of squares of errors.

```{r}
sleep$fitted_vals_rem <- fitted(lm(REM ~ Age,
                                        data=sleep))

ggplot(sleep, aes(x=Age, y=REM)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "#FF6B6B", size=1.4) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = Age, yend = fitted_vals_rem), alpha=0.2) +
  xlab("Age") +  # X-axis label
  ylab("REM Sleep (in minutes)")  # Y-axis label
```

```{r}
lm(REM ~ Age, data=sleep)
summary(lm(REM ~ Age, data=sleep))
confint(lm(REM ~ Age, data=sleep))
```

Interpretation of the coefficient beta1: We estimate the average minutes
of REM sleep to decrease by 0.08531 when increasing age by 1 year.

Interpretation of estimate of beta0: We estimate the average minutes of
REM sleep to be 105 for a person aged 0 years.

The P-value is 0.45, which is > 0.05 (alpha). Thus, we fail to reject
the null hypothesis, meaning there is no relationship between Age and
REM sleep in healthy adults.

Additionally, the 95% Confidence Interval is (-0.3074703 and 0.1368443),
meaning we are 95% confident that the true population parameter lies
within the interval. Since the interval includes zero, it cannot be
confidently determined that age positively or negatively impacts REM
sleep solely based on this interval.

In summary, the results of the confidence interval are consistent with
the p-value because the confidence interval includes 0 and the p-value
is greater than 0.05, so there is NOT a statistically significant linear
relationship between Age and REM sleep in healthy adults.

### Multiple Linear Regression to find the association between REM sleep and Age when taking into account the effect of Gender

```{r}
lm(REM ~ Age + Gender, data=sleep)
summary(lm(REM ~ Age + Gender, data=sleep))
confint(lm(REM ~ Age + Gender, data=sleep))
```

Interpretation of the estimate of beta1: We estimate the average minutes
of REM sleep to decrease by 0.04483 when increasing age by 1 year and
keeping gender constant.

Interpretation of the estimate of beta2: Baseline: women When we change
from women to men, we expect the average minutes of REM sleep to
decrease by 4.25019 when keeping age constant.

Interpretation of the estimate of beta0: We estimate the average minutes
of REM sleep to be 106 for women aged 0 years.

P-values: -Age(X1): 0.698 -Gender(X2): 0.139

Confidence Intervals: The 95% confidence interval for REM sleep (Y)
ranges from approximately 96.555 to 115.278. The 95% confidence interval
for Age (X1) ranges from approximately -0.273 to 0.183. The 95%
confidence interval for Gender (X2) ranges from approximately -9.89 to
1.39.

The confidence intervals provide a range of values within which we can
be reasonably confident the true population parameters (REM, Age, and
Gender coefficients) lie.

P-value and CI interpretation: Since the P-values for both Age(X1) and
Gender(X2) are greater than 0.05 (alpha), we fail to reject the null
hypotheses. Thus, meaning that there is not strong evidence of a linear
relationship between Age and REM sleep when taking Gender into account.
Likewise, there is not a significant difference in REM sleep between
females and males when keeping age constant.

Additionally, since the confidence interval for Age(X1) includes zero,
it cannot be confidently determined that age positively or negatively
impacts REM sleep solely based on this interval. Likewise, the
confidence interval for Gender(X2) includes zero, it means that the true
difference could be zero (no difference) or positive (indicating higher
REM sleep in females), but it cannot be confidently determined based on
this analysis alone.

## Conclusion

In summary, the results of the confidence intervals are consistent with
the p-values because the confidence interval includes 0 and the p-value
is greater than 0.05, so there is NOT a statistically significant linear
relationship between Age and REM sleep in healthy adults AND NOT a
significant difference in REM sleep between male and females. Further
investigation or a larger sample size may be needed to draw more
definitive conclusions.

More so, our results are inconsistent with scientific literature since
its reported REM sleep gradually decreases with age (Floyd et al).
Ultimately, then, this could be an indication that there is a nonlinear
relationship between REM sleep and age.

However, our findings of the average minutes of REM sleep are consistent
with scientific literature since its reported the second and later
cycles of REM sleep last approximately 90-120 minutes (Carskadon and
Dement, 2005).

## Future work

All in all, there are multiple ways to improve this analysis. Foremost,
a larger sample size is need to better represent the true population and
provide more accurate results. Also, this dataset relied on surveys,
which is a very subjective in nature. Thus, more refined and objective
research methods are required to improve accuracy. Additionally, this
dataset lacked availability of its raw data. Thus, more reproduciblity
is required for overall accuracy and trustworthiness.
